A watch winder is a device that is used to keep an automatic (self-winding) watch running when it’s not being worn. 

Despite their growing popularity, some say watch winders are only useful if you want to damage your watch. 

I’ve owned several watch winders before, and I’ve had both positive and negative experiences with them. 

Here’s the thing: 
 
**You get what you pay for. Only poorly designed (and cheap) watch winders will damage a watch. If you purchase a high-quality watch winder, you won’t be disappointed. When used properly, a quality watch winder is a useful tool.**

## Do Watch Winders Damage Watches? 

This is how a watch winder works:
 
A watch is placed into a special compartment which makes a specific number of rotations within a certain amount of time, slowly spinning in both directions. 

As a result, your watch will never stop ticking, as lubricating oil is evenly spread throughout the watch movement.
                             
This method is completely safe for automatic watches as they have a defense mechanism to protect against overwinding. 

## How a Watch Winder Can Damage a Watch

Poor quality watch winders can damage your watch.

If a magnet comes in contact with a watch, the internals can become magnetized (which will break them). 

Your watch consists of many small metals which can easily be magnetized. The magnetic field makes the internals stick together, so it cannot effectively keep time. 

Most cheap Chinese watch winders – due to the way they’re made – will magnetize a watch. When your watch is magnetized, it doesn’t run as it’s supposed to.

Luckily, this isn’t something that can’t be fixed. Just take it to your local watchmaker and they will know how to restore your watch.

Faulty winders may also overwind your watch, which also damages the internals.  

Watches are built to withstand constant motion, but there is no benefit to wind a watch that is already wound. 

For example, if a watch needs 500 turns per day and you put it on a winder that is set for 1000 turns per day then you risk getting extra wear and tear on the winding gears.

However, if your watch requires 850 turns per day and you put it on the same winder, it would be no problem as the extra revolutions will not hurt your watch. 

It’s advised to buy a winder that can be programmed to suit the requirements of your watch.

It all comes down to the quality of the winder. A well-designed watch winder might be costly, but at least you won’t risk damaging your watch. 

They are also helpful for watches that are very complicated to set. Think of continuous calendars or astrological timepieces — you will save yourself a headache by using a winder for these type of watches.  

## Are Watch Winders Necessary? 

After doing some research I can tell you that in general, watch winders are not necessary.

They are merely a convenience as they make it possible for you to wear your watch after a few days – or weeks – of not wearing it.

A watch winder can be helpful if you are not a daily wearer. Letting your watch(es) sit for a long time without any movement can cause the oils within to settle and clot.

Putting them on a watch winder will prevent the oils from settling.     
But as I said, they are more of a convenience than a necessity. 

A watch winder becomes unnecessary when you take the time to wind and set your watches manually.

Many people prefer this over winders as manually winding your watch allows you to really appreciate the watch and its craftsmanship. 

## Types of Watch Winders

There are several types of watch winders, including: 

### Functional Watch Winders 

They are simple and usually wind up one or more watches. Rather basic, they can usually wind several watches at once. 

Functional winders solely concentrate on practicality and performance per dollar. 

A good example would be the Orbita Sparta Bold Black Watchwinder 2. This winder concentrates on  simplicity as can be seen from the design. 


### Stylish Watch Winders 

These winders carry the same concept as functional winders, but they are slightly more expensive as they offer a more sophisticated form and exterior. 

Generally, they are completely sealed off in a box that is handmade of finished wood or covered in leather. They are suitable for various display options like on a desk, but they also fit inside a drawer or safety box. 

The Heiden Quad Watch winder can be categorized as a stylish winder. It has multi-watch rotating holders and the watches are nicely sealed off in a leather box with glass protection. 

### High-end Watch Winders 

If you want to take it a step further, you can buy yourself a luxurious watch winder. 

These winders contain built-in storage cabinets, tiny-clock-harmonized time displays and even warmers to keep the watch near body temperature. 

These are the most expensive winders you can get. One of the fanciest 
winder would be the BRABUS SV12 watch safe. It has 12 watch winders and a design significant to BRABUS supercars. 

The drawers are lined with red Alcantara leather and the interior cabinetry is produced from wood, carbon fiber, and leather. 

The BRABUS SV12 is a device made for storage and security. 

Within these types are various options such as a/c and battery powered units. 

## How to Use a Watch Winder (Without Hurting Your Watch) 

First, a winder cannot wind a watch that is fully stopped so you want to manually wind up your timepiece to get it running.

Then you want to carefully place your watch in the winder. Remove the cuff and make sure the timepiece is securely situated on it. 

You’ll want to flip the cuff over, compress the foam, and clasp the timepiece securely on the cuff.

Next what you want to do is put the cuff inside of the winder. Turn the winder on and voila, you now know the safest way to use a winder without damaging your watch.
