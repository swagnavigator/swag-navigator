## Choosing the Best Solar Powered Watch for You

Solar powered watches otherwise known as solar atomic watch are not much different from your typical watch. Both types give timekeeping as well as additional features depending on the model. They both have a range of styles from highly formal to highly casual to highly athletic. As well they come with different designs, colours, detailing and accessories. The main difference is that their power source is the sun.

Solar powered watches are powered by built-in solar panels. Usually, these are around or on the dial to maximize the incoming light. These solar panel cells will convert light into energy to store within the battery. It’s an efficient method as the batteries will power your watch even when there is no available light. This means that your watch is constantly operating regardless of where it is. Even if it’s in a bag, or hidden behind clothing it will still operate. Additionally, sunlight is not the only light source that can charge the solar panels. It is preferable but other light sources will charge it but at a different rate.

There is also an environmental benefit to having a watch powered by solar energy. This kind of energy is a renewable source of energy -- it doesn’t run out. Due to the technology of solar energy, there isn’t waste as there would be in other kinds of power. Compared to typical watches that use batteries, these watches are a more environmentally friendly alternative. Each year millions of batteries are recycled but unfortunately, not all of them are. The ones that are disposed of into landfills leach chemicals into the surrounding area. These contain materials that are toxic to the environment such as mercury, lithium or cadmium. Improper disposal of waste batteries leads to pollution of various ecosystems as well as water pollution.
 
The list of benefits is not only about saving the planet, it’s also about saving time and money. With a solar watch, there isn’t a requirement to replace the batteries. Typically, once your watch battery is depleted, you would buy a new one to replace it or take it into a jeweller or watch repair shop. There aren’t batteries to replace which means there aren’t batteries to buy or to pay for. This would save you money and time in the long run as this is a step taken away from the very start. You don’t have to worry about the watch’s battery stopping. If you forget about your watch’s battery, it can be frustrating since it usually stops at the most inconvenient of times. Solar watches don’t require battery replacements as there aren’t batteries to replace. It’s as simple as putting on your watch and starting your day.
 
Buying a solar watch already gives you the convenience of a renewable and convenient power source. But choosing the watch is another step. What are you going to be looking for in a solar watch?
 
Style and function are the main things to look for. You need a watch that looks great and works great. Both of those things are subjected to you as a person for what you’re looking for. Solar watches, like most accessories, are designed for a range of people, and a range of needs. There are both formal and casual watches. There are both slim and athletic watches. Regardless of your requirements, solar watches are available. Whether you are backpacking across the Canadian Rockies or presenting to a boardroom, there is a watch for you.
 
Style is something that’s individualistic, subjective even. You want something that matches your fashion sense and what you’re going to be wearing along with the watch. Stylishness isn’t one thing, it’s a combination of details that make up something wholly individual, something that’s entirely you. Those small details are important and picking the right watch is no different. A watch is a functional accessory that adds to your overall appearance by adding a subtle sophistication. The watch you choose needs to be one that matches your style. For example, the man who wears a business suit every day needs a watch that adds to it and heightens the elegance. The Men's Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch by Citizen from our compiled list is a perfect example as it’s a gorgeous stylish watch. Its design is minimalist, formal and simple to match with any business suit. Then the working man who wears business casual every day doesn’t need a watch that’s of that same formality. A simple, timeless model would do perfectly. The Signatur Watch by Skagen would be the perfect addition to business casual attire. Its design is minimalist but stands out with the gorgeous blue, silver and yellow colour scheme. This stylish watch can be matched with a relaxed business suit or even informal jeans and polo.
 
Function is what you want the watch to do. A watch isn’t just used for the aesthetic, it’s a tool. Depending on what you need from your watch will determine the kind of watch you’ll get. Formal watches have basic functionality and are more centred around style. Whereas athletic watches are more centred around durability. Athletic watches have more flexibility, durability, ease of access, and controls for on the go. There are watches with several kinds of additional features; waterproofing, smartphone connection, Bluetooth technology, atomic timekeeping, world times, shock resistance, perpetual calendar, compass, thermometer, among so many more. Casio’s "Pathfinder" Watch contains several features for the man that’s active and requires a tool more than an accessory. The athletic look doesn’t quite lend itself to match with a suit but works perfectly with gym shorts and sweat. However, there is a compromise for function and style. Casio’s Edifice Watch is a perfect blend of the two. This sleek yet sporty design is perfect for anyone that needs the functions listed but wants to remain stylish.
