The model 17205 is an accessory that will stand out among the rest of the watches in your personal watch collection.
 
This model is creative and beautifully unique with the combination of complementing red, black and gold hues. 

Its practical features and good-looking design set it apart from other watches in its weight class. 

For example, crystal type-flame fusion with 18k gold ion-plating and synthetic-sapphire dial window ensure an amazingly durable watch resistant to scratches and scrapes, far beyond average daily wear and tear. 

The dial window itself is somewhat jam-packed, yet still organized (once you get used to it). It features various sub-dials, including a 60-second, 60-minute, and 1/10-second dial. 

This watch’s Japanese quartz movement with an analog display, fold-over clasp closure, and a date window all add to its sophisticated appearance. Among the aviator collection from Invicta, this watch is designed with versatility, style, and comfort in mind.

## Introduction to Invicta

Invicta is a Swiss watch brand dedicated to creating high quality watches with superior craftsmanship, continuing innovation, and amazing value. According to their website, their mission statement describes their dedication to quality timepieces at a decent price: 

“May all those who possess our timepieces and pass through our doors experience the quality, value and care in every piece we create as well as the spirit of never-ending possibilities in everything we do”.
As a brand, Invicta has been expanding in both quality, innovation and customers steadily over the years. According to Invicta, “over half of Invicta consumers own 10 or more Invicta’s while we gain over 100,000 new such collectors annually”.

With over 30 collections including Marvel, Invicta Cruise, Pro Diver, Reserve, and Russian Diver (just to name a few), this brand has over 1000 models. It’s not a surprise that they continually attract customers. They boast a wide variety of models in terms of aesthetics, and functions, for any price point. Without a doubt, they deliver.

However, with hundreds of models under the Invicta name, it’s hard to choose a perfect watch. That’s where the buyer’s guide comes in to play – we’re going to highlight the features to look for in your next Invicta watch. 

### Style

To start, style encompasses the design of the watch, its visual appeal. A watch allows the wearer to make a statement to the world around them using the watches’ aesthetics which include the colors, materials, craftsmanship, shape and so much more. 

In general, there are three kinds of aesthetics when it comes to watches: 

Formal, casual and athletic. 

Regardless of the set categories, many watches fall into multiple, or are a blend of them. As Invicta has beyond 30 collections with more than 1000 watches, there’s bound to be a great watch for your aesthetic.

In an interview with Time Zone, Eyal Lalo, President of Invicta Watch Company is a third generation watchmaker explained that their watches are high quality for a low price. 

Eyal explains that there’s a bit of a contrast online within the watch collector’s community:
<blockquote><p>
“Some people just cannot swallow the fact that you can buy a good product from us at such a low price. And consider the watch a collection piece or a piece that they can admire and that they can keep, and can take care of, and that they can clean. It's not a throw away watch. Something that will last them a long time, probably as much as the other higher end brands,”</p></blockquote>

Eyal continues, 

<blockquote><p>
“On the other side of the coin, there are people out there complaining about there being some very expensive watches out there. It's just a question of name and fashion and that's it.”</p></blockquote>

###Water Resistance

Water resistance is the ability of the watch to withstand water, from a quick splash to recreational swimming all the way to professional deep water diving. 

Depending on your requirements for the watch’s performances, it may be a vital thing to consider before you buy a watch.

Watches will typically be designed to withstand the everyday exposure to water such as hand washing, sweat, rain, and splashes. However, anything more such as bathing, or diving requires a higher degree of water resistance.

At the lower end, watches will withstand water and moisture from accidental splashes but not much else, unfortunately. A water resistance of 30 Meters (100 Ft or 3 ATM) will withstand water from everyday use such as accidental splashes, hand washing, the weather, and the pool but won't be able to withstand deeper water. 

For that, you’ll need to purchase a dive watch crafted specifically for use deep under water. 

### Watch Size

This one – although incredibly important – is often overlooked. The size of your wristwatch is going to affect not only how well it fits your wrist, but how it looks as well. 

You should consider: 

* Case diameter 
* Case thickness
* Band width 

Measuring your wrist is all it takes to ensure you’re buying a watch of the proper size.

Case diameter will usually range between 45 mm at its largest to 38 mm at its smallest. Wrists that are 6 to 7 inches fit 38 mm to 42 mm watches the best, while 7.5 to 8-inch wrists fit cases that are larger such as 44 mm to 46 mm the best. 

The smaller a watch looks the more it leans towards subtle jewelry. On the other hand, the larger a watch is, the more it seems to be flashy.

Don’t make the mistake of buying a watch that’s far too small or too large for your wrist – either way, it will look a bit goofy. You need to find one that compliments your wrist well. 

It should be large enough for people to know it’s there, without demanding too much attention. 

### Materials

Invicta is known and loved for their high-quality materials normally only found in top-tier watches. 

According to Invicta’s description of their brand: 

“From skeletonized movements to a unique gold layering technique to exceptional construction, Invicta has become one of the most technically capable watchmakers in the world.” 

Stainless steel is currently one of the most popular materials within the watch collector community and is used in the majority of both cases and straps. 

As a metal, stainless steel itself is very durable and hypoallergenic which allows it to withstand daily wear and tear quite well.

There are different materials used for the watch face itself, which are (hopefully) meant to withstand scratches. 

The three main types of crystals typically used in the covering of the watch dial are acrylic, mineral, and sapphire. 

Acrylic crystal is an inexpensive plastic material allowing small scratches to be easily buffed out. 

The next is mineral, containing several elements heat treated to allow a hardness capable of withstanding scratches and other forms of damage. 

The last and most expensive (and durable) is sapphire, which is nearly 20 times harder than acrylic crystals and three times harder than mineral crystals.
