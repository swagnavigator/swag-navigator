Mechanical watches immediately stand out from your average modern watch as the original watches, but you want to make sure that the watch you get is a perfect combination of nostalgia, function and fashion.

Watches are simply aesthetic tools with a specific purpose, in the most modest terms. Mechanical watches are arguably the most time-honoured type of watches as gears power them instead of electricity. 

Regardless of the historical nostalgia, these mechanical watches have kept up with the times ensuring their innovation and relevance.

![Victorinox Watch](/img/watches/mechanical/victorinox.jpg){: .img-right}

This is a gorgeous watch with a simple yet elegant style. The dark blue dial and bright silver indexes, hands and numbers contrast one another allowing the watch to stand out. 

Additionally, the case itself is stainless steel surrounding a stunning indigo dial with luminescent hands. Within the dial, there is unidirectional bezel function with a count-up scale, military time, a date window, and power indicator.

Anti-reflective sapphire material makes up the dial itself, which is one of the most expensive crystals because of its durability. This material is approximate 20 time harder than acrylic crystals and 3 time harder than mineral crystals. 

What this means for this analog watch from Victorinox, is a hardy and durable watch that won’t give a glaring reflection and is scratch resistant. With a double locking fold over clasp, combined with a hypoallergenic stainless-steel band provides a perfectly secure and comfortable watch for day to day wear.

![Reef Tier Watch](/img/watches/mechanical/reef.jpg){: .img-right}

![Charles Hubert Watch](/img/watches/mechanical/charles.jpg){: .img-right}

In terms of style, this watch is like that of the Akribos Xxiv. However, this Charles Hubert watch differs as it provides an elegant watch that’s more geared toward a formal watch. 

Created with elegance in mind, the wearer can see every gear, pin, screw through the skeleton dial. All of it is on display. 

Adding to the elegance is the attention to details within the engraving throughout every gear creating a breathtaking design that draws in the eye and keeps it there. 

Without a cover, the blue hands contrast beautifully against the metallic mechanics of the watch. Add a genuine black calfskin leather band with an easy to access buckle, and the contrast merely continues to the entire watch to create a captivating statement piece.

Along the side of the case, are silver roman numerals contrasting against the black dial as to not interfere with the skeleton dial. Additionally, there’s a sub dial at the position of 9 o’ clock to display a sixty-second hand.

## Buyer's Guide

With the innovation in our technology sector, there have been several innovations in the of timepieces. Smart watches, google watches, apple watches, have become a prominent fixture within the market. 

Even before then, cellphones (and now smart phones) took away the base need for a wristwatch. People can simply look up the time using their phones. More than that, calendars, world clocks, speedometer, and much more are right within our pockets. 

In recent years there’s been a debate about the benefit of mechanical watches in a time of digital watches or smart watches. 

In an interview with The Verge, John Tarantino founder and CEO of the mechanical watch company, Martenero, explains the difference between the two within the same type of market.

“I’m really curious to see the market response. Right this second, I wouldn’t say I consider it a threat,” he explains, “yes, the price points are similar, but they’re pretty different products right now, and I think [they] appeal to a different sensibility”.

What’s the point of a traditional watch when there are other more advanced options available? They provide additional functions that a mechanical watch simply can’t provide. 

However, there’s something that smart watches also can’t provide. Watches, and specifically mechanical watches, are now loved for more than function. There’s a style to them, a nostalgia if you will. 

Many would regard watches in the same way that people regard vinyl records or French pressed coffee, or vintage cars. However, there’s a kind of sophistication to watches that can’t be replicated in terms of creative advancements. 

In an era of the apple smart watch, it’s hard to know if there is a place for mechanical watches. Tarantino thinks there is and there will be for a long time to come.

“Watches are about a lot more than telling the time,” he explains, “when you wear a watch, I think a lot of people think it says something about them, and they like for people to notice their watch.”

Though the watch industry has made huge innovative strives and enhanced precision, design and engineering, the aesthetic itself hasn’t been altered. Gears, springs, screws, wheels, and pendulums make up a watch, but they aren’t the only thing to go into a watch. 

There’s also delicate craftsmanship, intricate detailing, and an immense attention to details. The creation of the watch and the watch itself is vastly intricate. 

Every watch is crafted by watchmakers with skills in precision, craftsmanship, manufacturing and detailing. Combined with the craftsmanship and the intricate internals of the watch itself, you have something that’s truly a work of art.

Mechanical watches are a kind of nostalgic timepiece that’s been around for centuries and will continue to be around for centuries more. Before the invention of electricity or batteries or solar power or quartz movement, mechanical watches were the way to tell time. 

To operate these mechanical watches, require manual winding. The mainspring is the power source within a watch. To give it the power it needs, the wearer would wind the watch using the crown, usually on the side of the case. 

The winding of the crown winds the mainspring and in doing so loads it with potential energy. After this happens, the gears within the watch use the tension to power the watch. Incrementally this stored up energy gets released and powers the movements of the entire watch.

Mechanical watches need to be wound on a regular basis to continue operating as they should. Instead of being powered for the long term with a battery, mechanical watches have a power reserve from the winding of the main spring. 

This power reserve is essentially the time it takes for it to unwind completely, thus losing all the tension that was built up. It averages between 36 and 42 hours before the watch needs to be wound again. 

Though each watch is different due to its design and craftsmanship, so the power reserve may range depending on the watch. The power reserve directly relates to the winding interval. 

Winding intervals or the time between windings will depend upon the watch itself. Some watches require winding every day, while some can last a couple of days between windings. 

Most watch enthusiast get into the habit of winding their watches daily. It’s easier to do it regularly than wait for the mechanism to wind down completely.
