## Buyer's Guide: Citizen Watches

Citizen is celebrating a century of superior watchmaking history. Their message is “better starts now”, which is a message that advocates for accomplishing goals that better the lives of people as individuals and as a society. 

As a brand, Citizen explains that everyone including themselves bears the responsibility to bring about a positive change in the world by creating a meaningful impact on the environment.

And that’s exactly what they do. Eco Drive is one of the aspects of Citizen that makes its brand so unique. 

Although Eco Drive uses a battery, it’s not your average battery. It’s a rechargeable battery that self-charges without any fuss from the wearer. 

Although similar to automatic watches that power themselves from the kinetic energy of the wearer, Eco Drive needs something simpler to continue operating: light. Citizen’s Eco Drive is a solar powered battery that relies on energy from light. 

This doesn’t limit its wearability though. Even in places that don’t receive a lot of light, such as the Arctic, or if your schedule doesn’t allow for a lot of time in sunshine, this watch will still operate as it should. 

A single battery lasts decades, plus it is still capable of gaining energy from sources other than direct sunlight. 

Although it garners energy from solar power, it’s more than a solar-powered innovation. This is an initiative to create responsible and renewable watches.

Citizen watches are beautifully crafted, each and every one. However, each model is unique and it’s vital that you find one that works for you. 

There are quite a few things that go into choosing the perfect watch: style, function, mechanics, and size.

### Style

To start, a watch’s style is more than its aesthetic. The style is what you portray when you wear it; it is the statement you want to make to the world around you. 

Watches come in a range of aesthetics, colors, and designs to give each watch a unique look. There are typically three kinds of aesthetics when it comes to watches: formal, casual, and athletic. 

Although there are three set categories, many watches fall into multiple categories or are a blend of them. 

For example, Citizen Model CA0649-06X, mentioned above, is ideal for the athletic business man on the go due to its additional functions, gorgeous aesthetic, and additional durability. 

On the other hand,  Citizen model AT2400-05A is a perfect combination of formal and casual as it has a minimal yet elegant design that allows it to match with formal wear, business suits, or casual attire seamlessly.

In the most modest terms, a watch is simply a tool to tell the time. A beautifully intricate tool but simple nonetheless. 

However, with increases in the innovation of the watch, this tool becomes more than a simple timepiece. 

There are countless additional features that make your watch more practical and your life more convenient. 

Citizen Model BL5403-03X is a perfect example of a beautiful watch with all sorts of bells and whistles. Its displays include both 12- and 24-hour time, an alarm, a perpetual calendar, and 1/20 second time.

### Movement Type

Another area in which watches differ is their movement, which is how the watch ticks. 

This is the most meticulous and intricate aspect of the watch, with watchmakers carefully crafting the mechanism to ensure superior operation. 

There are three main types of movements, which are also known as calibers within the watch industry – each with their own benefits. 

Quartz is a watch movement caused by a battery. 

Mechanical movement provides a traditional and near historical style watch as they are powered by gears instead of electricity. 

Automatic watches are like mechanical watches, but they use kinetic energy from the wearer’s natural movements to wind the mechanisms within the watch. 

In a quartz watch, the power comes from the battery itself which requires only maintenance from the wearer. In a mechanical watch, it requires manual winding to power the watch’s gears. 

Where mechanical and quartz differ in terms of watch operation is of course how they are powered but also in the motion of the second hand. 

A mechanical watch’s second hand will have a sweeping motion while a quartz watch will have the second hand move in individual ticks.

### Watch Size

Something that the new collector wouldn’t necessarily think about is the size of the watch. This means ensuring the right fit for your wrist, as well as knowing how the watch will sit upon your wrist. 

The watch case diameter, case thickness, and band width all contribute to how large or how small the watch will appear while you wear it. 

Those with small wrists need to be aware of how a large watch will appear. The larger a watch looks, the more it tends to be for showy or flashy attire. 

On the other hand, those with large wrists need to be aware of how a small watch will appear. The smaller a watch looks while wearing it, the more it leans towards a style of subtle jewelry.

The best way to ensure that you get a perfect fit for the perfect watch is simply to measure your wrist. 

Case diameter will usually range between 38 mm to 45 mm at its largest. Wrists that are 6 to 7 inches fit 38 mm to 42 mm watches the best, while 7.5 to 8-inch wrists fit cases that are larger such as 44 mm to 46 mm the best.
