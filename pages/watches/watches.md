Here's the deal:

What you wear is a reflection of your personal taste.

What does this mean for you?

The clothes and accessories you choose must be a reflection of the image you wish to project on others. 

Although many men often overlook accessories, having a timepiece on your wrist is a crucial component of any outfit. 

It should be something you would wear with pride, regardless of the season, time, or current trends.

However, not all watches were created equally. 
 
In order to make a sensible choice, you must first learn more about watches and what makes them tick.

Get it? What makes them tick? 

In this article I intend to show you what you need to look out for before you purchase a good quality wrist watch. 

So, without further ado, let's begin.

## Best Invicta Watches

[Invicta watches](/watches/invicta/) are elegantly crafted with high-quality materials. 

When you buy an Invicta watch, you can really feel (and see) the quality. 

They pride themselves in creating affordable luxury watches. 

If you want to look incredibly stylish on a budget, then an Invicta is probably right for you.

## Best Citizen Watches

[Citizen watches](/watches/citizen/) are also highly praised in the watch community, not only for their quality design but for the craftsmanship that goes into every watch as well. 

After putting a nice watch on your wrist, you'll immediately look more put together, stylish, and confident. 

If you want to look more stylish and confident, you should consider purchasing a Citizen watch.

## Best Wooden Watches

[Wooden watches](/watches/wooden/) are definitely unique, to say the least. 

The entire casing (and sometimes even the watch strap) is crafted with wood. 

Wooden watches are – when done right – eye-catching, stylish, and a great way to bring your outfit to the next level. 

Sure, they may be a bit different, but that makes them an even better way to stand out in a crowd.

## Best Automatic Watches 

Self-winding watches – otherwise known as [automatic watches](/watches/automatic/) – are pretty awesome as well! 

They're easy to maintain, stylish, and you can usually find great watches for a low price.

## Best Mechanical Watches 

[Mechanical watches](/watches/mechanical/) are more traditional, but still an essential part of any serious watch enthusiast's collection.

Unlike automatic watches, mechanical watches must be wound manually on a regular basis. 

You can either choose to wind the watch yourself, or you can use a watch winder instead. 

Either way, mechanical watches are a bit more high maintnence than a digital watch, for example. 

Still, there's something soothing about winding/maintaining a watch yourself...

## Best Solar Watches 

Most watches are powered by a small watch battery. 

They need to be replaced from time to time, and a faulty battery will completely prevent your watch from functioning. 

Solar watches, on the other hand, are entirely powered by the sun. They're pretty darn cool, and they still look as good as a regular watch.

## How to Choose a Watch That Suits You 

Price is not the most important aspect to consider when purchasing a watch.

Although most folks have a specific budget in mind, it is better to spend a little extra to buy a quality watch. 

One of the first criteria that comes up in a watch purchase is the price.

However, it is more important to consider the value of a watch before discussing pricing.
 
Ask yourself these questions before deciding which watch you want to buy: 

1.  How often do you use it?
2.  How do you feel when you wear it?
3.  Does it reflect who you believe you are?
4.  How much does it cost?
5.  What type of watch would you like to have?
6.  Does the movement type matter to you?
7.  Brand?
8.  Features?
 
Making a wrist watch selection is a personal thing, because it should reflect your personality. 

Although many may deny it, keeping track of the time is one of the primary considerations a person has. 

With so many things that must be accomplished in one day, it is necessary to constantly watch the time to make sure that everything is done on schedule.

The watch is undoubtedly the preferred complement for many men. 

Considering we can check the time with our phones these days, a watch's primary function is to serve as a fashion statement. 

A man with a watch appears more put together, sophisticated, and dominant. 

Of course, it's important to consider the different types of watches before making your decision.
 
## Most Popular Watch Styles
 
When I'm asked "which watch type is the best", I always give the same answer. 

There is no singular best watch type just like there is no singular best car. 

It all depends on what you're looking to do with your watch, and more importantly, your style. 

Your watch needs to showcase your style and personality – it's a fashion statement. 

Here’s what you really need to know about the different types of watches on the market.
 
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="analog watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/analog.jpg" />
### Analog Watch
 
An analog watch comes with a miniature clock-face of 12 hours, with an hour-hand and a minute-hand. 

Some modern analog watches offer a third second-hand, for better accessibility.

### Digital Watch
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="digital watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/digital.jpg" /> 


A digital watch doesn’t come with a dial for the hour, minute, or second-hands, like an analog watch. 

Instead, the hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed digitally on a display screen.

### Automatic Watch

An automatic watch is also commonly referred to as a self-winding watch. 
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="automatic watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/automatic.jpg" />

It runs automatically, backed up by a metal weight called a rotor. 

The rotor supplies energy to the watch to function day and night without wearing down.

An automatic watch is more skilled and energy-efficient than an analog or digital watch. 

### Dress Watch
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="dress watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/dress.jpg" />
 
A dress watch is the most stylish and sophisticated watch to buy.

It comes in different styles including contemporary, modern, and minimalistic. 

The best part about buying a dress watch is that it can be paired up with formal, dressy outfits, like a suit or a tuxedo. 

Nothing completes a fancy look quite like a sophisticated dress watch!

### Quartz Watch
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="quartz watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/quartz.png" /> 

A quartz watch comes with a high-powered electronic oscillator which is synchronized by a quartz crystal. 

This is one of the most expensive watches you’ll find. 

Quarts watches boast accurate and efficient performance, but they require battery replacements from time to time. 

Nevertheless, they’re definitely worth the effort because of their stellar reputation, performance, and reliability.

### Aviator Watch
<img class="img-right lazyload" alt="aviator watch example" data-src="/img/watches/styles/aviator.jpg" />

An aviator watch is also commonly referred to as a pilot watch. 

It’s the toughest and most effective watch on the market. 

Aviator watches tend to do a great job combining pleasant design features with durability. 

### Smart Watch

As you probably already know, smart watches are a recent 21st century phenomenon. 

It’s a portable device that is generally controlled by your smartphone, offering tons of goodies such as fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and app support.

All these categories of watches are chargeable and use a touchscreen – some are even waterproof.

## How Tight Should a Watch Be?
