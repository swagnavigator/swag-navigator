Some may say size doesn’t matter, but when it comes to a watch, it surely does. 

As a watch owner, you want to ensure that your watch fits perfectly for aesthetic, comfort and functionality. 

After doing a lot of research, asking watch connoisseurs, and experimenting on my own, here's my take on how tight a watch should be: 

**Every watch owner has their own preferences to their watch's function, style, material, and movement – the fit of the watch is no different. Ultimately, the perfect watch fit is up to the wearer and what they find comfortable.** 

## How Should a Watch Fit, Exactly? 

This may seem obvious to some, but it's still important to note. 

Watches should fit comfortably –  neither too tight nor too loose.

A watch is too tight if the watch itself leaves imprints or marks in your skin. 

The imprints mean that the watch is digging in, causing discomfort and possibly restricting blood flow. 

On the other hand (no pun intended), a watch is too loose if it slides easily around your wrist, or if you can fit several fingers underneath the band. 

Having a watch fit too freely increases the chance for damages or scratches to the watch.

The size of the watch itself is also important to pay attention to. 

Both wrists and watches range in sizes, thus it’s important to get the right size of watch in terms of case diameter to ensure the proper fit.

Wrists 6 to 7 inches tend to complement 38 mm to 42 mm watches the best, while 7.5 to 8-inch wrists best complement larger cases including 44 mm to 46 mm the best. 

The smaller a watch appears, the more it looks like jewelry. 

Therefore, women’s watches tend to be smaller. On the other hand, the larger a watch appears, the more it looks flashy.

## An Example of How a Watch Should Fit

When I bought my first watch, it was difficult for me to have it fitted because it had a metal band with links. 

I took it to a professional watch maker to have him size it for me. 

When I bought my Invicta watch, on the other hand, I was very surprised by not only how good it looked but also by how well it fit.

I actually spent several hours writing a post all about the [best invicta watches](/watches/invicta/) – they're super good-looking but they won't break the bank.  

Regardless of the purpose or aesthetic of the watch, it still needs to fit your wrist.

Watches designed for formality, athletics, function, travel, business and so on, don’t negate the need to have a watch fit properly. 

A perfect fit needs to be loose enough to move slightly but not enough to move extensively around your arm.

In the image below, the watch fits perfectly by providing a snug fit that still allows some movement:

This next image is an example of what can happen when you wear a watch too tight:

![example of a bad watch fit it is too tight](/img/how-a-watch-should-fit/too-tight.png){: .img-middle}

Below, the watch is too loose, as the wearer could easily stick several fingers within the band. 

More than that, the watch will move too much around upon your wrist.

A perfect fitting watch will be close-fitting enough to remain fairly stationary on your wrist but unrestricted enough to allow for slight shifting.

## How to Make a Watch Fit Your Wrist Perfectly 

If you're still having trouble fitting your watch, this section will help. 

If you want your watch to fit perfectly, you need to: 

1. Measure your wrist
2. Adjust accordingly 
3. See a local watchmaker (if necessary)

### Step 1: Measure Your Wrist

To measure your wrist, take a flexible measuring tape and wrap it around your wrist just below the wrist bone. 

Measure your wrist size as that has an immense impact on how watches will fit upon your wrist. 

A wrist measurement gives you the information you need to make an informed decision about your watch, taking the guessing out of the process of purchasing. 

If you’re purchasing watches online, having a wrist measurement on hand will assist you in knowing how a watch will fit without needing to try it on.

### Step 2: Adjust Accordingly

Many watches have bands that are adjustable. Leather, nylon, satin, fabric, and rubber bands will more often than not have clasps that you can adjust as needed. 

These are amazingly helpful as they’re adjustable if the measurement of your wrist changes for whatever reason (pregnancy, bloating, illness, weight loss or gain, and so on).

### Step 3: Seek A Local Watchmaker For Adjustments If Necessary

A watchmaker will be able to adjust any watch for you, regardless of the type or style. 

For watches with linked bands, a watch maker can add and remove links depending on what’s needed. 

For watches with a kind of buckle, they are able to add additional holes for better adjustability.

## What Hand Should a Man Wear a Watch On? 

Typically, people [wear their watch on their non-dominant hand](https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/22/which-wrist-should-you-wear-your-watch-on-7651689/){: target="_blank"}. If you’re right-handed then you’d wear your hand on the left wrist and vice versa. 

This is to ensure that the watch doesn’t restrict the wearers’ activities. It’s difficult to try to write or cook for example while wearing a watch on your dominant hand.

Unfortunately for left-handed folks, watchmakers design most watches for right-handed individuals as they are the majority. 

Though that doesn’t mean that left-handed people are completely left out, there are watches designed with you in mind.

## What Hand Should a Woman Wear a Watch On? 

Women’s watches follow the same general principle as above. Typically, the watch is worn on the non-dominant hand to allow for maneuverability and function. 

If you’re right-handed then you would wear your watch on your left hand. This is to limit the amount of interference that the watch has with your daily activities.

Women’s watches tend to be slightly smaller. Depending on the design of the watch itself, wearing the watch on the dominant hand won’t interfere with day to day activities.

## Should a Watch Be Able to Rotate on Your Wrist? 

No, at least not easily. Your watch should be able to stay fairly stationary on your wrist without excess movement. 

If your watch is able to move freely on your wrist, it means that the watch is fitting too loosely. 

This has an impact on your watch’s longevity as it’s more likely to scrape or bang against things accidentally.

## Watch Pinky Rule: What Is It, and Is It Important? 

The watch pinky rule says that you should be able to fit your pinky underneath of the bracelet. 

It's not too tight, but your watch won't slide more than an inch either up or down your arm. 

This means that when you wear your watch, it shouldn’t be able to move exaggeratedly on your wrist either up or down, or to slide around so that the face of the watch moves. 

If this happens it means that your watch is too big for your wrist and needs to be adjusted. However, your watch still needs to be able to have some movement else it’s too constricting. 

If you’re not able to move your watch at all, this restricts your movement and results in uncomfortable imprints in your skin.

The general rule is that movement under an inch means that your watch is fitting properly. 

This rule ensures that the watch is neither too tight nor too loose, providing a comfortable range between the two and allowing for a decent amount of movement. 

As to the exact amount of movement within the watch, that is up to the individual for what feels the most comfortable.

## Should You Wear a Watch Above or Below Your Wrist Bone? 

Under your wrist bone is the best place to wear one’s watch. Regardless of the size or style of the watch, it looks best when it’s actually right on your wrist. 

Typically, watches are worn just underneath with the face of the watch not going over. The reason for this is that the wrist bone helps keep your watch in place and not slip off of your wrist. 

For those working outside, or in non-typical environments, it helps make sure their watch doesn’t fall easily off of their wrist risking damages or loss.

## Why is Proper Watch Fit Important? 

Wearing a watch that fits you well is incredibly important, for many reasons.

### Aesthetics

Having a watch that fits properly enhances the overall appearance of the watch and consequently your overall appearance. 

Having a watch that’s too loose or too tight may not seem overly noticeable since it’s an accessory but it is noticeable, and it looks unprofessional and sloppy. 

A watch that fits properly adds to the overall outfit and appearance.

### Comfort

A well-fitting watch is one that fits comfortably. This is the important aspect of a watch fit. 

There will always be a variety of fittings depending on the person, the style, environment, and the watch itself.

### Function

Without a good fit, a watch can’t function at its best. A watch is a tool. It can’t work if it’s too small and cutting off circulation to portions of your wrist, or if it’s too big and is moving while you try to check the time. 

A proper fitting allows your watch to work for you and not against you.

## Conclusion 

Overall, size does matter in terms of the fit of your watch. A proper fitting watch is just as important as other aspects of the watch; style, function, comfort, material. 

Wearing a watch too tight isn't going to [cause your watch to stop working](/why-watches-stop-working/) or anything like that, but it will definitely be uncomfortable. 
 
The fit of the watch is one of the many details that are vital to owning a watch. In order to fit properly, a watch needs to be a balance between tight and loose, with the perfect amount of movement. 

The way the watch fits upon your wrist is more than simply a fit. It affects the way a watch feels, looks, as well as it’s longevity as well as providing style, coziness, and purpose.
